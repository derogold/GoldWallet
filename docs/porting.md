## Porting WalletShell for Another Currency

> Note that this is only valid/possible for `turtle-service` compatible currency (e.g. a TurtleCoin fork).

You can modify WalletShell to be used for your own `turtle-service` compatible currency with few simple steps (assuming you already grab the source code by cloning our repo):

### 1. Update package.json
This step is important in order to avoid conflict with the original WalletShell (or other fork), when user happen to install both wallet version.

Edit `package.json` file, change the values of the following keys:
- `name`
- `productName`
- `appId`

### 2. Update ws_config.js
Edit `src/js/ws_config.js` file, update config values to match your currency configuration/requirements.  
Each config item are pretty much self explanatory and are commented for clarity.

### 3. Re-skining (Optional)
If you want your version of WalletShell looks different than what provided by default, you can do a few tweaks to re-skin/updating the appearance:
- Edit `src/css/common.css` to modify general appearance (layout, sizing, color, etc)
- Replace `src/assets/image/*` with your own images.

### 4. Rebuild/package your wallet for distribution
Please refer to the build guide on the repository [main page](https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtle-wallet-electron).
