# WalletShell

![WalletShell Logo](docs/walletshell.png)  
This is a GUI wallet for TurtleCoin made using Electron, this means it's written in JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 

It is meant to be able to work on Windows, Linux and MacOS, however so far we've only been able to test it on Linux &amp; Windows.

### Notes

WalletShell relies on `turtle-service` to manage wallet container &amp; rpc communication.

WalletShell release packaged includes ready to use `turtle-service` binary, which is unmodified copy TurtleCoin release archive.

On first launch, WalletShell will try to detect location/path of bundled `turtle-service` binary, but if it's failed, you can set path to the `turtle-service` binary on the Settings tab.

If you don't trust the bundled `turtle-service` file, you can compare the sha256 sum against one from the official release, or simply download and use the binary from official TurtleCoin release, which you can download here: https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtlecoin/releases. Then,  make sure to update your `turtle-service` path setting.
