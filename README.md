### Notes

GoldWallet relies on `DeroGold-service` to manage wallet container &amp; rpc communication.

Release installer & packaged archived includes a ready to use `DeroGold-service` binary, which is unmodified copy of DeroGold release archive.

On first launch, GoldWallet will try to detect location/path of bundled `DeroGold-service` binary, but if it's failed, you can manually set path to the `DeroGold-service` binary on the Settings screen.

If you don't trust the bundled `DeroGold-service` file, you can compare the checksum (sha256sum) against one from the official release, or simply download and use the binary from official DeroGold release, which is available here: https://github.com/derogold/derogold/releases. Then,  make sure to update your `DeroGold-service` path setting.
