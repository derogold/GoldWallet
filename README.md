### Building/Packaging WalletShell
You need to have `Node.js` and `npm` installed, go to https://nodejs.org and find out how to get it installed on your platform.

Once you have Node+npm installed:
```
# assuming you're building it on GNU/Linux
# first, download turtle-service binary for each platform
# from TurtleCoin official repo
# https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtlecoin/releases
# extract the turtle-service executable somewhere

# clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtle-wallet-electron
$ cd turtle-wallet-electron

# install dependencies
$ npm install

# create build+dist directory
$ mkdir -p ./build && mkdir -p ./dist

# copy/symlink icons from assets, required for packaging
$ cp ./src/assets/icon.* ./build/

# build GNU/Linux package
$ mkdir -p ./bin/lin
$ cp /path/to/linux-version-of/turtle-service ./bin/lin/
$ npm run dist-lin

# build Windows package (you need to have wine 2.0+ installed)
$ mkdir -p ./bin/win
$ cp /path/to/win-version-of/turtle-service.exe ./bin/win/
$ npm run dist-win

# build OSX package
$ mkdir -p ./bin/osx
$ cp /path/to/osx-version-of/turtle-service ./bin/osx/
$ npm run dist-mac
```

Resulting packages or installer can be found inside `dist/` directory.
